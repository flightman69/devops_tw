                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other
practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and
change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of
a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GPL for many of our projects.
